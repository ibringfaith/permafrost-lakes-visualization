# NSDC Data Science Project: Permafrost Lakes in the US and Canada Data Visualization

In this project, I learn about the lakes in North America with a focus on permafrost lakes. By doing so, I practise my pandas skills and think about different ways of visualizing data using Python. After each plot, I answer a question based on what I've learned while creating the visual.
